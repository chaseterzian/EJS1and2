What is an operator? What kinds of operators are there in JavaScript?
  Unary
  Binary
  Ternary - only  ?:
    a === b? 'yes' : 'no'
    conseptually a little bit like an if else statement


    +, -, *, /, %%, ||
    Symbolic
    Behaves like a method or function
    Classification (UBT) refers to the number of arguments
    Operand Operator Operand
    5         +         5

______

What are null and undefined? pg18
  Special Values: Absence of a meaningful value
  (placeholder for a value?  a void?)

What are Types?
  Of values
    numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, undefined values

What data types are primitve to JavaScript?
    object, string, number, undefined, boolean, null, symbol

What is type coercion? pg18
  When an operator is applied to thew wrong type of vale:
  Converting the value to the type it wants

Why is == evil? pg19
  JS will try to convert one of the values to the other values type sometimes
  use ===

How does short-circuit evaluation of logic work? pg19/20
  The values on the left are evaluated first, for:
  && - if the first is false, doesnt even look at the right
  || - if the left is true, doesnt even look at the right

Variable
  a label for a value, points to where a value lives in the computer memory

What is variable assignment? Variable reassignment? pg24/25
  Variable are ways to 'catch' and hold values , they dont contain them, they point to them, or 'grasp' them.
      variable for 5 * 5 will point to 25, not become 25
      = can be used to change this variable, and make it point to another
      Two variables can point to the same value, not contain values that equal eachother**

What are valid variable names in JavaScript?*******

Explain how memory is allocated for variables.********

What is the environment? pg26
  The collection of variables and their values that exist at a given time

What are functions? pg27
  A piece of program wrapped in a value

What is a while loop?
  A way to repeat code to satisfy a condition it:
    Initializes*, Checks*, and Updates* until condition is met

What is a for loop?
  Shorter more inline way of writing a while loop?  And doesn't make nearly as much sense

What is a switch statement?
  like and if statement -
    The program will jump to the label that corresponds to the value that 'switch' was given
    or to default if no matching value is found

What is a comment?
  //   syntax for being able to type comments

How does variable scope work in JS
 function() {

 }
__________________________________________________
While Do LOOPs - Ex.

var product = function(array) {
  var result = 1;
  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i ++) {
    result *= array[i];
    };
    return result;
};


var product = function(array) {
  var result = 1;                     var result = 1, i = 0;
  var i = 0;
  while (i < array.length) {
    result *= array[i];               result = (result * array[i]);
    i = (i + 1);
  }
  return result;
};


__________________________________________________
Switch Case

switch(condition) {
  page 35
}
__________________________________________________

RETURN

Ruby
  def moo
    "moo"
  end

  moo
> "moo"
______
JS

  var moo = function() {
    "moo"
  }

  moo();
> undefined


  var moo = function() {
    return "moo"
  };

  moo();
> "moo"


__________________________________________________

 var num = 12
 Declaring functions -


 funkt = function() {
   console.log("hi");
 };                   define before a call
                      introduces local scope
                      declaring a variable whos value is a function

 function funkt() {
   console.log("hi")
                      DONT USE - why?
 };                   declaring a function
                      can define the fuction after youve already used it
                      introduces global scope
                      if this was nested inside another function, the variable would
                        still be global??

var nums = [1, 2, 3]

nums.forEach(function(argument)) {
  console.log(argument);
});
                      another way - ask

smilar to:

nums.each do |argument|      <---  ruby
  puts argument
end

 to invoke the function -
  funct()    <--

  invoking
  calling or
  applying the function


  foo = "foo"     is global      DONT USE - why?
  var foo = "foo" is local       USE
___________________________________________________
Control Flow
  controlled sequence of events

while
for
if, else
do (while) - code in here will be executed at least once
switch
break
continue

These things modify the flow of the application in different ways



___________________________________________________

Three primary trypes of operators
  Unary
  Bunary
  Ternary

    Symbolic
    Combines values
    Does something
    Behaves like a method or function


_____________________________
Q's


function part of the list?

String(null).toString

What does the greyed out thing mean in NODE

Node vs, Chrome vs JSBin

Side effects

Math in language vs just on a computer - bits?
